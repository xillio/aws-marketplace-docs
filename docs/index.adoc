=== Find Xillio API Credentials

There are two ways to find the generated Xillio API credentials. If you have ssh access you can get the credentials
by <<ssh, logging in through ssh>>. If you do not have ssh access you can get the credentials <<system-logs, from the
system logs>>.

[#ssh]
==== Method 1: Obtain Credentials Through SSH

minutes for the system logs to show up.
